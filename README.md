## Comparison of model predicted- and measured stable isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor with a focus on Mediterranean

### Overview of the research

> Changing climate is causing critical water scarcity and management issues in many regions
of the world, including the Mediterranean, which makes it inevitable to accurately predict the
changes in hydrological cycle. As it is essential in giving accurate assessment of water resources
of the region. Studying stable isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor is a key parameter
which can be used in understanding the water availability and movement, moreover it can also
help in predicting the possible changes in hydrological cycle. My present research aims to
contribute to the existing knowledge and understanding of the isotopic composition of atmospheric
vapor in the Mediterranean region. According to some recent studies in this area, isotopic
compositions obtained from measured and model predicted sources are significantly different. My
thesis work is seeking to build on the earlier findings by comparing measured data from Global
Network of isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) and ECHAM6-wiso model predicted data.
Furthermore, the variability of isotopic composition is assessed across various climatic regions
contributing to the water cycle of the Mediterranean. This study includes eight cities in the region
which are Ankara, Avignon, Cairo, Lisbon, Madrid, Rabat, Rehovot, and Vienna.
The results obtained from the comparison of model predicted and measured isotopic
compositions, suggest that there are differences between the atmospheric vapor compositions from
the two sources. The model tends to show different results for the selected cities. For (i) Cairo,
Rabat, Rehovot and Lisbon it underestimates the δ
18O and δ
2H values; for (ii) Ankara, Avignon
and Madrid, time series analysis shows periods both with under and overestimation, while for (iii)
Vienna time series shows over estimation for some months in the selected time frame.
Furthermore, additional statistical tools were used to further analyze the model performance for
the study period. The implications from this study can be used for the understanding of
hydrological cycle and in predicting the future climate change. Additionally, accurate depiction of
isotopic composition of water vapor is essential for improving atmospheric and climate models.
Overall, the thesis tries to highlight the importance of comparing global general circulation
models (GCM) like ECHAM6 on regional basis, to get the insights about the accuracy of the model
for different regions. And it’s implications in usage of these models for interpretation of
paleoclimate records and hydrological cycle dynamics. As the current research is based on the
limited time series available, further research is needed for an assessment over a longer period,
10
which will help in understating the factors that influence the isotopic composition of atmospheric
water vapor and examine the insights collected from this study.
